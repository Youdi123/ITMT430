<h3>critique</h3>
<p>The shortcoming in this group cooperation is that the time of joining the team is a little delayed due to my own problems. Since I was absent from last week's class, teamwork helped me understand this group assignment and finally determine the work of IT OPERATIONS. It is necessary to contact the team members in time for the next group assignment.</p>
